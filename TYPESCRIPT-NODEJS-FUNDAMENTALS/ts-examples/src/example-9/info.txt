1. An asynchronous operation is a task that runs independently of the main program flow, 
allowing the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.

2. In summary: 
synchronous operations wait for each task to finish before moving on to the next. 
asynchronous operations allow tasks to run independently, making the program more efficient.
